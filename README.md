## Feed Reader Testing
### Use Jasmine test exist Feed-Reader App

#### About
In this project I'm given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer already included Jasmine. Unfortunately, they left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I come in.

#### Aim
1. Get familiar with Jasmine, use Jasmine to complete the test suites.
2. Write a number of tests against a pre-existing application, test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
3. Understand TDD (test-driven development).

#### What have been done

1. Completed Test Suit: 'RSS Feeds'
2. Added Test Suit: 'The Menu', 'Initial Entries'(async), 'New Feed Selection'(async)
3. Make sure each spec in Suits independent (Run separately)
4. Implement error handling


#### How to Run

1. Clone or download from [this repository](https://github.com/ivyfu77/Feed-Reader-Test.git) 

`$ git clone https://github.com/ivyfu77/Feed-Reader-Test.git`

2. Open index.html in your browser (Can open directly, no webserver needed)
3. Check Jasmine result at the bottom of page. Click link "Ran 1 of 7 specs - run all" run all 7 specs, Click each spec to run it separately.
